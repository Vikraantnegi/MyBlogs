# Product Requirements Document: Template Management Platform & WunderGraph GraphQL Layer

## 1. Product Overview

The Template Management Platform and WunderGraph GraphQL Layer form the core of a template-driven UI framework. This system allows for efficient management of UI templates and seamless integration with backend microservices through a GraphQL interface.

## 2. Objectives

- Streamline the creation, management, and deployment of UI templates
- Provide a unified GraphQL interface to aggregate and transform data from various microservices
- Enhance developer productivity and reduce time-to-market for new features
- Ensure scalability and performance of the overall system

## 3. Target Users

- Frontend Developers
- UI/UX Designers
- Backend Developers
- DevOps Engineers
- Product Managers

## 4. Key Features

### Template Management Platform
- Template creation and editing interface
- Version control for templates
- Template preview and testing
- Template deployment and rollback mechanisms
- Access control and user management
- Template analytics and performance metrics

### WunderGraph GraphQL Layer
- GraphQL schema generation from microservices
- Query aggregation and transformation
- Real-time subscriptions
- Caching and performance optimization
- Security and authentication integration
- API versioning and deprecation management

## 7. Functional Requirements

### Template Management Platform
- CRUD operations for templates
- Template versioning with diff view
- Role-based access control
- Template preview with mock data
- Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git)
- Template deployment to staging and production environments
- A/B testing capabilities for templates
- Analytics dashboard for template usage and performance

### WunderGraph GraphQL Layer
- Automatic GraphQL schema generation from REST, gRPC, and other API types
- Custom resolvers for complex data transformations
- Real-time subscription support
- Batching and caching mechanisms
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Logging and monitoring of GraphQL operations

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: The system should handle at least 1000 concurrent users with response times under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling capabilities to handle increased load
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for the platform
- Security: Implement industry-standard security practices, including encryption at rest and in transit
- Compliance: Ensure GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations are met
- Extensibility: Provide APIs and webhooks for integration with external tools and services

## 9. Integration Points

- Version Control Systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- Authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, SAML)
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for template distribution
- Analytics platforms for usage tracking and reporting

## 10. Future Considerations

- AI-assisted template generation and optimization
- Multi-language support for internationalization
- Integration with design systems and component libraries
- Advanced caching strategies (e.g., edge caching)
- Support for serverless and edge computing deployments
- Machine learning-driven performance optimization
